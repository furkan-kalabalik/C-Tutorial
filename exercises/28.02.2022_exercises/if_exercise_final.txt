Write a C program that performs bit operations(set, clear, toggle) for 2 bits. Number, operation and bit numbers must taken from user. If the operation is not supported print error.

INPUTS
-------
int operation --->  0 = clear, 1 = set, 2 = toggle 
int number
int bit0, bit1

OUTPUT
------
int new_number

Test Case
----------
INPUTS														OUTPUT
operation = 0, number = 7(0111), bit0 = 1, bit1 = 2			new_number = 1 (0001) 

INPUTS				OUTPUT
operation = 4		Error ! UnSupported Option !
