int freqArray[12] = {2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7}; 

Write a program in C to find the number of times 
(frequency) occurs a given number in an array.

HINT:
    Create a counter value and search input in the array and 
    when you find value inside array, increment the counter.
INPUT:
    Enter number that you want to find frequency: 4
OUTPUT:
	freqArray is 	  : 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7
	Frequency of 4    : 4
