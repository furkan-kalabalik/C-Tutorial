int exampleArray3[9] = {54, 42, 30, 24, 27, 7, 19, 17, 73}; 

Find biggest and smallest value in array.
HINT: 
	For finding biggest start with some smallest arbitrary value.
	For finding smallest start with some biggest arbitrary value.
	Loop through the array.
		For finding biggest If the current value is bigger than 
		the current biggest value,
			set the current value as the new biggest value.
		For finding smallest If the current value is smaller than 
		the current smallest value,
			set the current value as the new smallest value.
	
OUTPUT:
	exampleArray3 is 	  : 54, 42, 30, 24, 27, 7, 19, 17, 73
	Biggest element    	  : 73
	Smallest element      : 7
