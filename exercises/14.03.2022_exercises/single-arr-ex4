int exampleArray4[5] = {1, 15, 39, 75, 92}; 

Find corresponding pair for given difference. 
If difference not occurs between pairs, print "No pair found".
HINT: 
	Use two for loops to iterate through the array.
	Find difference between all pairs, and check 
	if difference is equal to given difference.(use substraction)
	If you find equality, print the pair using loop index values.
INPUT:
	The given difference is : 53
OUTPUT:
	exampleArray4 is 	    : 1, 15, 39, 75, 92
	The pair are     	    : (39, 92)
