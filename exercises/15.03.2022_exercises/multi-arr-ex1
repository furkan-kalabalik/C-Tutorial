int array1[2][2] = {{1,2},{4,5}};
int array2[2][2] = {{1,2},{4,5}};

Write a program in C to accept two 2d array and 
check whether they are equal

HINT:
    Use two for loop for rows and columns. 
    Check every corresponding index,
    and compare them. If you found a mismatch, 
    break loop. Use flag to check
    whether they are equal or not.
OUTPUT:
	For equal case: ----> "Arrays are equal."
    For not equal case: ----> "Arrays are not equal."
