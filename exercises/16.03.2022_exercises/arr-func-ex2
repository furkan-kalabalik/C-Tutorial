int arr[]= 
{1, 3, 3, 8, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3};
1,3,3,8 = 15 splittable
3,2,3,7 = 15

Write a function in C to check if an array can be splitted 
in such a position that, 
the sum of left side of the splitting is equal 
to the sum of the right side. If it
can be splittable, return 1, else return 0. 

int isEqual(int array[], int length) {
    int equal = 
    
    if(equal)
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}

HINT:
    Write a function takes array as argument. Inside function calculate sum of
    both sides and check if they are equal, if they are equal, return 1, else return 0.
OUTPUT:
    "They can be splittable"
    "They cannot be splittable"
