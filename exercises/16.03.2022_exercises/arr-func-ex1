int diag1[3][3] = {
                    {4, 0, 3}
                    {0, 1, 0}
                    {5, 0, 4}
                };

For a given 2d arrays, if sum of left and right diagonals are same,
then it is a magic square.
For given array, write a function, 
which returns 1 if it is a magic square, else 0.

HINT:
    You need to just Calculte the sum of left and right diagonals.
    Use two for loop, think your numbers, make table on paper then 
    write code.
    Create function that takes your array, 
    and returns 1 if it is a magic square, else 0.
    Use your function to check if given array is a magic square.
    Don't forget to call function in main function. 
    You need to make calculation in function.
OUTPUT:
	diag1: "Magic Square"
    diag2: "Not a Magic Square"
