int diag1[3][3] = {
                    {4, 0, 3},
                    {0, 1, 0},
                    {5, 0, 4}
                };
4 -> (0,0)     3 ->(0,2)
1 -> (1,1)     1 ->(1,1)
4 -> (2,2)     5 ->(2,0)
For a given 2d arrays, if sum of left and right diagonals are same,
then it is a magic square.
For given array, write a function, 
which returns 1 if it is a magic square, else 0.

int isMagicSquare(int diag[][3]){
    //Fill here
}

if(isMagicSquare(diag)) {
    printf("Magic Square\n");
} else {
    printf("Not a Magic Square");
}

HINT:
    You need to just Calculte the sum of left and right diagonals.
    Create function that takes your array, and returns 1 if it is a 
    magic square, else 0.
    Use your function to check if given array is a magic square.
    Don't forget to call function in main function. 
    You need to calculation in function.
OUTPUT:
	diag1: "Magic Square"
    diag2: "Not a Magic Square"
