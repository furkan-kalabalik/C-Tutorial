int arr[13] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3,14, 13, 45, 56, 3, 5, 7};

For a given array, write a function that takes an array and 
a number,
as input and return the frequency of the given number 
in the array.

int calculateFrequency(int arr[], int x){
    //Fill here
}

prinf("Frequency of %d is %d\n", x, calculateFrequency(arr, x));

OUTPUT:
    Enter number you want to find frequency: 3
    Frequency of 3 is 3
