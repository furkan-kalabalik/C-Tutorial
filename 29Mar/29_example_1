You will create a linked list. Search linked lists on google.

First create a struct called NodeStruct without using typedef. 
This struct will hold the int data 
and  the pointer to the next node which has type struct NodeStruct next.

Then using typedef do:

typedef struct NodeStruct Node;

You need to create a function called createNode. This function will take an int
and returns a Node value. Inside the function you need to create a Node and
initialize it with the int value. Also fill next with NULL. Then return created Node.


Node createNode(int val){

}

Then in your main you will create 3 Node using the createNode function.
Then create a Node *head variable. Then assign the address of the first Node
to head.
After chain first Node to the second Node. And goes like that. Since the
last node not chained to any of other Nodes it next will point to NULL.
Don't forget that.

Then create a function called printList. This function will take a Node as
parameter. Inside the function you will print the data of each node.

void printList(Node *head){

}

OUTPUT:
    3 -> 55 -> 1 ->
