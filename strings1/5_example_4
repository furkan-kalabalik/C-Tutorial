Create a struct called Person using typedef and the following fields:
    char name[50];
    int age;
    double height;
    double weight;

Create a function called createPerson that takes Person pointer 
and fills the fields inside function with the following values:
    name: "John Doe"
    age: 30
    height: 1.80
    weight: 75.5

void createPerson(Person *person) {
    // your code here
}

Then create a function called printPerson that takes Person pointer
and prints the following:
    Name: John Doe
    Age: 30
    Height: 1.80
    Weight: 75.5

void printPerson(Person *person) {
