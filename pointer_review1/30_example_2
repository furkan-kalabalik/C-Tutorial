For each of the following, write a statement that performs the indicated task. Assume that
floating-point variables number1 and number2 are defined and that number1 is initialized to 7.3 .
a) Define the variable fPtr to be a pointer to an object of type float .
b) Assign the address of variable number1 to pointer variable fPtr .
c) Print the value of the object pointed to by fPtr .
d) Assign the value of the object pointed to by fPtr to variable number2 .
e) Print the value of number2.
f) Print the address of number1 . Use the %p conversion specifier.
g) Print the address stored in fPtr . Use the %p conversion specifier. Is the value printed the
same as the address of number1 ?
