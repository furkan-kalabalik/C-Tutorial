Create a struct called Time with three fields: hours, minutes, seconds.
Think hours, minutes and seconds as numbers and their range.
In struct define bytefields for each field.
Use unsigned integer type for each field.

Create a function called showTime() that takes a Time struct as an argument.
This function should print the time in the following format:
    HH:MM:SS

Also print size of Time struct.
It is aligned?
