Create a struct called Student that contains the following data:
    int id;
    float examResults[3];

Create a struct called Class that contains the following data:
    int numberOfStudents;
    Student *students;

Create a function that takes a pointer to a Class and returns the average of all exam results.

float classAverage(Class *c) {
    
}

Create a function called mostSuccessfulStudent that takes a pointer to a Class and 
returns a pointer to the student with the highest average exam result.

Student *mostSuccessfulStudent(Class *c) {
    
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside main, create an array of Students called students.
Then initialize your students array with the following data:
    Student students[3] = {
        {1, {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}},
        {2, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}},
        {3, {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}}
    };

Then create a Class called class and initialize it with the following data:
    Class class = {3, students};

Finally, call your classAverage and mostSuccessfulStudent functions and print the results.
