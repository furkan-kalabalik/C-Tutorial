Create char arrays in your main as follows:
    char word1[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
    char word2[] = {'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '\0'};
    char word3[36];

Create a function callet merge that takes 3 parameters:
    char *word1
    char *word2
    char *word3

In this function word1 and word2 should be merged into word3.
Don't forget to add '\0' at the end of word3.

You cannot use [], you need to use pointer arithmetic.

void merge(char *word1, char *word2, char *word3)
{
    
}

Create another function called printWord that takes a parameter:
    char *word

In this function you will print given word, char by char until
you reach '\0'.

In your main use word1 and word2 that is defined at line 2 and line 3.
Then also define word3 in your main as line4. After that call merge with
word1, word2 and word3. Then after merging call printWord with word3.

OUTPUT:
    hello
    world
    hello world
