Create a struct called "DebtRates" that contains the following fields:
    int *debts;
    float *rates;
    int size;

Inside main create 2 array. One for debts and one for rates.

int debts[] = {100000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000};
float rates[] = {0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05};

Also create a struct called "DebtRates" and initialize it with the 2 arrays.
Don't forget to initialize the size field.

Then create a function called calculateProfit that takes a pointer to a struct as a parameter.
This function will find profit of each debt for banks with the given rates.
Then will sum all profits and return it.

Profit will be calculated as follows:
    profit = debt * rate

int calculateProfit(DebtRates *debtRates) {
    int profit = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < debtRates->size; i++) {
        profit += debtRates->debts[i] * debtRates->rates[i];
    }
    return profit;
}

Then call the function and print the result.
