You will use random number generator 
to generate random numbers.
You will create 3x3 2D array and 
fill it with random numbers.
You will print the array.

You cannot use brackets. 
You need to use pointer aritmetics.

Random number generator works as follows:
int main() {
    srand(time(NULL));
    int random = rand() % 100;(Creates numbers between 0-100)
    return 0;
}

//Part1
Create a function that takes a 2D array as pointer,
int row and int column as parameters.
The function should fill the array with random numbers.
void fill2DArray(int *arr, int rows, int cols) {
    //your code here
}

//Part2
Create a function that takes a 2D array as pointer,
int row and int column as parameters.
The function should print the array.
void print2DArray(int *arr, int rows, int cols){
    //your code here
}

//Part3
Create a function that takes 3 2D arrays as parameters.
The function must sum the first two array and store the result in the third array.
void sum2DArray(int *arr1, int *arr2, int *arrSum, 
    int rows, int cols) {
    //your code here
}
